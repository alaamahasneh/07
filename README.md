 / (division)
 * (multiplication)
 ++ (increment)
 -- (decrement)
 % (modulus)

##A BASIC FUNCTION :

to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
this is known as afunction declaration.
Havind declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
This is known as calling the function.
